# Filing a Code of Conduct Violation Report

We take reports of violations to our project
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) with the utmost seriousness and
will act upon them as quickly as possible.

To report a Code of Conduct violation to our Code of Conduct Committee, you may reach out to us by email at
[coc@instructlab.ai](mailto:coc@instructlab.ai). The email will be read and acted upon by our Code of Conduct Committee
members.

If you experience a Code of Conduct violation in our InstructLab Discord or Slack workspace, please follow the
instructions in our moderation guides:

- [Slack moderation guide](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/InstructLab_SLACK_MODERATION_GUIDE.md#reporting-abuse)
- [Discord moderation guide](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/InstructLab_DISCORD_MODERATION_GUIDE.md#reporting-abuse)

As part of our follow up on your report, we would like to contact you for further discussion. If you would prefer not to
engage beyond reporting the matter to the committee, please let us know that as part of your submission. We will respect
your request.
