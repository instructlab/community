# InstructLab Discord Moderation Guide

The purpose of this document is to describe how users of the
[InstructLab Discord server](https://instructlab.ai/discord) can report abuse within the Discord server and to provide
server administrators with an easy-to-use guide for channel moderation.

## Reporting Abuse

Should any community members using the InstructLab Discord server feel that they have experienced behavior that violates
our [project Code of Conduct](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), they are welcome
and encouraged to contact the members of the
[Code of Conduct Committee](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT_COMMITTEE.md) for help.
Mentioning `@dog-watch` will notify all members of the moderation team so that they can assist you.

In the event that you do not receive help within a timely fashion – and we will do our very best to respond right away –
you can ask for help from the server admins by either joining the `#ask-an-admin` channel or mentioning `@admins`. If
you feel that it is a personal matter, you can also ping one of the people with the role of `#dog-watch` directly.

## Moderation Guide

Moderation activities can only be performed by users who are designated as server administrators (i.e. `@dog-watch`/
`@lead-retriever`).

## Server Administrators

At the time of writing this, anyone with either the `@dog-watch` or `@lead-retriever` role is considered to be a
moderator or administrator respectively.

\+ Members of the
[Code of Conduct Committee](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT_COMMITTEE.md)

## How We Moderate

### Deleting Inappropriate Comments

Upon a report of abuse to the [Code of Conduct Committee](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/COCC.md)
or, alternatively, if needed to the server administrators due to a coverage gap, the appropriate parties will assess
the situation.

The first step will be to remind individuals to abide by the [project Code of Conduct](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Inappropriate or offensive messages will be deleted. To delete a message, simply click on the three vertical dots that
appear when you hover over a message, or on mobile simply tap and hold on a message, and then click the **Delete**
button:

![Delete Message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/instructlab/community/main/public/images/discord_delete_message.png)

Deleting a message shall be done at the sole discretion of the Code of Conduct Committee and/or server administrators.

### Removing Server Members

Admins should consider first removing the offending person's messages from the channel in which the unacceptable
behavior occurred and having a conversation with them via Direct Message (DM) to remind them of their responsibilities
to abide by the [project Code of Conduct](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as
part of their participation in the InstructLab community.

If a user is a repeat offender, after being warned, their account can be
[kicked/banned](https://whop.com/blog/how-to-kick-someone-from-a-discord-server/) by an admin, depending on the
situation.

For more details on moderating a Discord server, please refer to the following guides:

#### Banning a Member's Account

If you feel that a community member is violating the
[InstructLab Code of Conduct](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please reach out
to the server moderators or the Code of Conduct Committee to receive further assistance.
