# Filing a Code of Conduct Violation Report

We take reports of violations to our project [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) with the utmost seriousness and will act upon them as quickly as possible. 

To report a Code of Conduct violation to our Code of Conduct Committee, you may reach out to us by email at [instructlab-cocc@osci.io](mailto:coc@instructlab.ai). The email will be read and acted upon by our Code of Conduct Committee members.

If you experience a Code of Conduct violation in our InstructLab Slack workspace, please follow the [instructions in our moderation guide](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/InstructLabSlackModerationGuide.md#reporting-abuse) to get immediate help in Slack.

As part of our follow up on your report, we would like to contact you for further discussion. If you would prefer not to engage beyond reporting the matter to the committee, please let us know that as part of your submission. We will respect your request.
