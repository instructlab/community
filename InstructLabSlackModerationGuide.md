# InstructLab Slack Moderation Guide

The purpose of this document is both describe how users of the InstructLab's [Slack workspace](https://instruct-lab.slack.com) can report
abuse in the Slack workspace and to provide space administrators with an easy to use how to guide for channel moderation.

# Reporting Abuse

Should any community members using the InstructLab Slack workspace feel that they have experienced behavior that violates our [project code of conduct](https://github.com/instruct-lab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), they are welcome and encouraged to contact the members of the [Code of Conduct Committee](https://github.com/instruct-lab/community/blob/main/COCC.md) for help. Mentioning <code>@cocc</code> will page all members of the committee so that they can assist you.

In the event that you do not receive help within a timely fashion - and we will do our very best to respond right away - you can ask for help from the workspace admins by either joining channel <code>#admin</code> or mentioning <code>@admins</code>.

# Moderation Guide

Moderation activities can only be performed by users who are designated as workspace adminstrators.

## How We Moderate

## Deleting Inappropriate Comments 
Upon report of abuse to the [Code of Conduct Committee](https://github.com/instruct-lab/community/blob/main/COCC.md) or, alternatively if needed to the workspace adminstrators due to a coverage gap, the appropriate parties will assess the situation.

The first step will be to remind folks to abide by the [project code of conduct](https://github.com/instruct-lab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  

Inappropriate or offensive messages [will be deleted](https://slack.com/help/articles/202395258-Edit-or-delete-messages#delete-a-message).

Deleting a message shall be done at the sole discretion of the Code of Conduct Committee and/or workspace administrators. 

### How to delete a message

## Removing Workspace Members

Admins should consider first [removing the offending person from the channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/201898668-Remove-someone-from-a-channel) in which the unacceptable behavior occurred and having a conversation with them as a DM to remind them of their responsibilities to abide by the [project code of conduct](https://github.com/instruct-lab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as part of their participation in the InstructLab community.

If a user is a repeat offender, after being warned, their account can be [deactivated](https://slack.com/help/articles/204475027-Deactivate-a-members-account#deactivate-someones-account) by an admin.

### Removing someone from a channel

- By default, Workspace Owners and Admins can remove people from public channels, and members can remove people from private channels.
- Anyone can be removed from a channel by those with permission.
- All members and guests need to be added back to a private channel to rejoin it, and guests also need to be added back to a public channel to rejoin it.
- It's not possible to remove people from the #general channel. However we plan to rename #general to #announce with posting permissions restricted to admins.
