StoneMason is an open source project designed to make model training more open, collaborative and iterative.

StoneMason is centered around Labrador 🐶, which is a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for Large 
Language Models (LLMs.) The "**lab**" in **Lab**rador 🐶 stands for **L**arge-scale **A**lignment for Chat **B**ots.

# The project is composed of the following components:

## Labrador 🐶 (LAB) Taxonomy

Labrador 🐶 is a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for Large 
Language Models (LLMs.) The "**lab**" in **Lab**rador 🐶 stands for **L**arge-scale **A**lignment for Chat **B**ots.

The LAB method is driven by taxonomies, which are largely created manually and with care.

This repository contains a taxonomy tree that will allow you to create models tuned with your data (enhanced via synthetic data generation) using Labrador 🐶 method.

## Labrador 🐶 command-line interface `lab`

Labrador 🐶 is a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for Large 
Language Models (LLMs.) The "**lab**" in **Lab**rador 🐶 stands for **L**arge-scale **A**lignment for Chat **B**ots.

This command-line interface for Labrador 🐶 (`lab`) will allow you to create models tuned 
with your data using the Labrador 🐶 method on your laptop or workstation.

## Model Training Infrasctructure

The infrastructure used to regularly train the model based on new contributions from the community is GPU intensive and generously donated and maintained by IBM.
