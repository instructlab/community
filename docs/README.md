# InstructLab Community Learning Guide

InstructLab crowd sources the process of tuning and improving models by collecting two types of data, knowledge and skills. These submissions are collected in a taxonomy of YAML files to be used in the synthetic data generation process.

We accept contributions of both Skills and Knowledge to InstructLab.
