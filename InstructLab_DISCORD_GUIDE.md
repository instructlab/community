# InstructLab Discord Server Guide

The purpose of this document is to inform members about how to join the
[InstructLab Discord Server](https://instructlab.ai/discord) and outline the channels available. We look forward
to meeting everyone and welcoming you to Discord!

## Overview

The InstructLab Discord server can be accessed via this [invitation link](https://instructlab.ai/discord).

Upon joining, you will automatically be assigned the `@Labs` role and gain access to the `#announcements` channel, as
well as a number of the other default channels. You are welcome and encouraged to join other channels that may exist.

All discussions in the InstructLab Discord server are governed by our
[project code of conduct](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Opt-in Channels

To ensure that users are not overwhelmed by notifications, we have a few automated channels as opt-in only. In order to
join them, visit the `#welcome-and-rules` channels and react with the emoji corresponding to the channel you wish to
join.

Currently, these channels are:

- `#receive-e2e-logs`: Pushes updates about E2E runs that take place in our GitHub CI, allowing users to watch for failures.

## Moderation and Reporting Abuse

We are an open, welcoming, and inclusive community and expect our members to be kind and respectful in all discourse.

We take reports of harassment very seriously and will address any reports of inappropriate behavior as quickly as possible.

To learn how to report abuse – and to whom you will be reporting – please see our [InstructLab Discord Moderation Guide](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/InstructLabDiscordModerationGuide.md).

## Having Trouble Joining?

If you are having trouble joining the InstructLab Discord server, please file an issue in the
[community repo](https://github.com/instructlab/community/issues) so we can help you.

TODO: Update with email address to get help once these are set up.

## Private Channels

InstructLab is an open-source project and we value defaulting to open in all of our community communications.
However, there are some cases where discussions must happen in private. For the sake of transparency, we are documenting
these private channels and their purposes.

- `#code-of-conduct-committee` – Space for the InstructLab
[Code of Conduct Committee](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT_COMMITTEE.md) to discuss
any reports of harassment or other violations of the project Code of Conduct and how to respond to them.
- `#admin` – Space for the InstructLab Server Administrators to confer privately only when
necessary. We default to open channels and hold each other accountable to do so.
