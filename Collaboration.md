# InstructLab Community Collaboration Spaces

We have a number of ways for folks to learn more about InstructLab, communicate with the project maintainers and their
fellow users, or subscribe for project updates.

## Getting Started with InstructLab

If you need help getting started with using or contributing to InstructLab, the best way to do so is via our
[project Slack workspace](#chat) or [email lists](#email-lists) rather than posts on social media.

## [Project Meetings](#project-meetings)

To stay up to date on when meetings are added and how to join them, subscribe to the
[InstructLab project calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_23c2f092cd6d147c45a9d2b79f815232d6c3e550b56c3b49da24c4b5d2090e8f%40group.calendar.google.com)
by clicking the button in the bottom right of the calendar view or simply add the
[InstructLab calendar ics feed URL](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_23c2f092cd6d147c45a9d2b79f815232d6c3e550b56c3b49da24c4b5d2090e8f%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)
to your preferred mail app.

The project will host more meetings as it evolves, but those we have already set up are listed here.

### [Weekly All Community Meeting](#weekly-all-community-meeting)

We host weekly community meetings each Tuesday at 14:00 UTC.
([time zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2024&month=5&day=14&hour=14&min=0&sec=0&p1=37&p2=43&p3=101&p4=224&p5=213&p6=771&p7=248&p8=2))

Weekly community meetings will feature regular updates on project happenings, including announcements, demos, places to
meet with the project maintainers, and more. The second half of the hour will be dedicated to community organization and
maintenance.

If you are new to the InstructLab project, the weekly community meeting is a great place to get started!

### [Weekly InstructLab CLI Meeting](#weekly-instructlab-cli-meeting)

We host weekly InstructLab CLI meetings each Thursday at 14:00 UTC.
([time zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2024&month=5&day=14&hour=14&min=0&sec=0&p1=37&p2=43&p3=101&p4=224&p5=213&p6=771&p7=248&p8=2))

Weekly InstructLab CLI meetings will feature announcements from the [CLI Maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md) team about the CLI
project, overviews of the general roadmap the project is taking via our
[Milestones](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/milestones) as well as the
[Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/instructlab/projects/2), and dedicated time for discussing the direction of the
project.

If you are particularly interested in the CLI aspect of the InstructLab project, we encourage you to join this meeting!

### [Office Hours](#office-hours)

We have two dedicated Office Hours slots each Thursday so we're able to meet with folks across different time zones. See
the InstructLab project calendar to select which time works best for you.

### [Triager Standup](#triager-standup)

We host daily Triage Team stand up meetings at 18:30 UTC.
([time zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2024&month=5&day=29&hour=18&min=30&sec=0&p1=37&p2=43&p3=224&p4=213&p5=771&p6=248&p7=2&p8=101&iv=1800)).
In this meeting, [triagers](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_ROLES.md#triager) speak and
discuss possible issues or successes with the different PRs put into the <https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy> repo.

If you have questions or ideas, we have an open door policy and would love for you to join us.

### [Weekly UI Team Meeting](#weekly-ui-team-meeting)

We host a weekly meeting on Wednesdays at 17:00 UTC
([time zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2024&month=5&day=28&hour=17&min=0&sec=0&p1=37&p2=43&p3=224&p4=213&p5=771&p6=248&p7=2&p8=101&iv=1800))
to review development underway to [create and iterate upon a GUI](https://github.com/instructlab/ui) for InstructLab.

If you are interested in user interface design, user experience, and simplifying the contribution experience, you are
welcome and encouraged to join.

## [Chat](#chat)

For real-time chat discussions, please join our
[InstructLab Slack workspace](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/InstructLab_SLACK_GUIDE.md).

Slack history is deleted after 90 days, so for conversations that should preserved for a longer period use the
[project mailing lists](#email-lists).

If you want to add feedback or think there is a "large issue" to discuss, a mailing list or a specific repository issue
tracker is a good place to have the conversation rather than Slack. If you are unsure of where to comment,
[users@instructlab.ai](https://groups.google.com/a/instructlab.ai/g/users) is the best place to start.

## [Email Lists](#email-lists)

We use the following email lists for project communications. Subscriptions requires a
[Google account](https://www.google.com/account/about/).

To join a list, click the list name in the table below to visit the list subscription page. If an entry below is noted
as an email alias or private to a specific group, you will not be able to join.

### [Who Can Post to and Read Each Mailing List](#who-can-post-to-and-read-each-mailing-list)

This table describes who can join each email list, view posts, etc. Some lists, such as the `coc` and `security` lists
are private so that reporting may be handled with discretion.

## [GitHub Discussions](#github-discussions)

We are using the GitHub discussion boards in each repo for cases where we need to document things quickly but
ephemerally, such as working together as a community to squash a nasty bug. In that case, a link to the appropriate
discussion board post will be sent to the relevant project mailing lists so folks can follow along on GitHub. Rather
than use the discussion boards to discuss proposals for enhancements or to request help with using InstructLab, please
reach out on the project [email lists](#email-lists) or [Slack](#chat).

## [Hugging Face](#hugging-face)

We regularly post model builds on the project's [Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/instructlab).

## [Social Media](#social-media)

The InstructLab project community maintainers will post regular updates on these social media services. Our project
hashtag is `#InstructLab`.

### [LinkedIn](#linkedin)

Follow our [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/instructlab) for updates.

### [X (Twitter)](#x-twitter)

Follow us on [X](https://twitter.com/instructlab) for our latest Tweets. Er, Xes. Er, posts of some sort.

### [YouTube](#youtube)

Subscribe to the [InstructLab YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@InstructLab) for regular updates when we post
video tutorials or playlists of talks about InstructLab from conferences and meetups.

## [Submitting content](#submitting-content)

Have you made a video tutorial, how to document, or other content that would be helpful to folks involved in the
InstructLab community? Thank you!

We would love to help you share it. Please
[file an issue in the Community Repo](https://github.com/instructlab/community/issues) or send a note to the
[community email](https://groups.google.com/a/instructlab.ai/g/community) list to let us know about what you have
created.
