# Contributor roles for InstructLab

InstructLab is made up of several projects that are defined as codebases and services with different release cycles.
Collectively, these enable large-model development. Currently, these projects include the following:

- [`ilab` command-line interface (CLI) tool](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab). This repository is responsible
  for the the `ilab` CLI tool.
- [taxonomy tree](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy). This repository is responsible for the taxonomy tree that
  allows you to create models tuned with your data.

This document outlines a core number of contributor roles for InstructLab projects, such as _Member_, _Triager_, and
_Maintainer_. An _Oversight Committee_ also serves to supervise the overall InstructLab project and its health. Using
transparent criteria, the journey between roles is based on individual participation.

Criteria will be reevaluated periodically to ensure that we can meet the needs of each project with the resources
available to contribute. Each individual project may add to or change these criteria as necessary. Additional roles may
also be added as required. Additional roles will be detailed in a _Contributor Roles_ file in the respective repository
when necessary. If no _Contributor Roles_ file exists in a repository, it is assumed to follow the scheme outlined here.

Contributor roles are per-project. For example, being a Maintainer for the `ilab` CLI repository does not guarantee that
you will have Maintainer rights for the taxonomy repository. Where applicable for InstructLab overall, contributor
status is equal to the highest status that they have on any project.

InstructLab welcomes new contributors. Not all contributors are able to provide sustained contribution, but each
contribution is welcome. Established contributors are expected to demonstrate their adherence to the criteria in this
document, familiarity with project organization, roles, policies, etc., and technical and/or writing ability.
Role-specific expectations, responsibilities, and requirements are explained below.

You can see all current team members via the automatically-updated
[MAINTAINERS file](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) in the Community repo.

After a
[decision has been made](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/governance.md#decision-making-at-the-instructlab-org-level),
a Maintainer will add you to the appropriate group within three weeks. A
[workflow](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/.github/workflows/periodic-maintainers-update.yml) runs
daily and will submit a PR to update the
[MAINTAINERS file](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) to reflect the membership.

### Member

## Stepping Down and the Emeritus Process

Life priorities, interests, and passions can change. Contributors can retire and move to _emeritus Maintainers_. If a
contributor needs to step down from their current role, they should inform the appropriate project Maintainers. No vote
is required for a contributor to remove themselves, and any project Maintainer can approve the PR. Maintainers who step
down become emeritus Maintainers.

If a contributor has not been performing the duties of their role for a consecutive period of 12 months, they can be
removed by the appropriate project's Maintainers. Maintainers will make reasonable efforts to contact the absent
contributor. If the [Code of Conduct Committee][committee] recommends that a contributor be removed from their role,
this will also be carried out by the project Maintainers.

If an emeritus Maintainer or other retired contributor wants to regain an active role, they can do so by renewing their
contributions, after which they can be re-instated by a decision of the appropriate project's Maintainers.

## Changes by Oversight Committee Members

The Oversight Committee has authority over all team membership. A member of the Oversight Committee may make changes to
team membership, including adding or removing members, at their discretion. When such changes are made, the Oversight
Committee member should notify the rest of the Oversight Committee so they are aware of the changes.

## Changes to contributor roles

Changes to contributor roles must be approved by a vote of the Oversight Committee or a majority of the current
project's Maintainers.

## Communication of contributor role changes

Changes to contributor roles must be communicated by a member of the Oversight Committee to the community. This should
be done via Discord, Slack and Email to an appropriate channel/list respectively. The communication should happen as
soon as the role change is made on GitHub.
