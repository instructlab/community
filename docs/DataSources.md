# [Data Sources](#Data-Sources)
The purpose of this document is to provide attribution required for data used in the InstructLab project including
data for pre-training, knowledge data, and skills data. 

For new contributions to InstructLab that require data along with 
the submission, we have thorough guidelines [TODO LINK TO GUIDELINES FOR CONTRIBUTING KNOWLEDGE] on how to provide 
attribution for these data sources. 

For data used to create the artifacts of the InsructLab project prior to its being open sourced,
we are [aware that this list is not comprehensive](https://github.com/instruct-lab/taxonomy/issues/255) at the time of creating it. 
The project maintainers will augment and update it over time to the best of our abilities.
