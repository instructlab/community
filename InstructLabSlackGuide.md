# InstructLab Slack Workspace Guide

The purpose of this document is to inform folks about how to join the InstructLab Slack Workspace and document the channels therein. We look forward to
meeting everyone and welcoming you on Slack!

## Overview

The InstructLab Slack workspace resides at <https://instruct-lab.slack.com>. You must join via this [invitation link](https://join.slack.com/t/instruct-lab/shared_invite/zt-2ginke0oz-SxvNYZCqBTDy5wzAi9WRlA)

Upon joining, you will automatically be added to our `#announce` channel. You are welcome and encouraged to join other channels.

All discussions in the InstructLab Slack are governed by our [project code of conduct](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Channel Overview

- `#dev` Cross-project coordination discussion, such as topics that cover both frontend and backend development for InstructLab
- `#admin` Place to get non-technical help. If you don't know where to go after reading this guide, join this channel for [air traffic control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control).
- `#announce` Project wide announcements such as releases, reminders about community calls, and celebrating new maintainers. This channel is moderated (only [Workspace Adminstrators](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/InstructLabSlackModerationGuide.md#workspace-administrators) can post) and low-traffic.
- `#backend` Backend work for the InstructLab project, including pipeline for synthetic data generation, training, model evaluation, and publishing.

- `#contribhelp` General questions about getting started as an InstructLab contributor. This channel is the place to go if you need help with your first pull request.
- `#docs` Documentation team discussions and questions about documentation.
- `#infra` Topics related to project infrastructure, such as repo maintenance, planned outages, or who has the keys to the social media accounts.
- `#frontend` Frontend work for the InstructLab project, including the CLI tool and User Interface
- `#social` Place to chat and enjoy camaraderie with fellow community members.
- `#triage` Triage team discussions.

## Usings Threaded Replies in Slack

By default, we use [threaded messages](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions) in Slack so as to keep all responses to a particular topic grouped together. Please reply to specific messages by replying in thread.

## Moderation and Reporting Abuse

We are an open, welcoming, and inclusive community and expect our members to be kind and respectful in all discourse.

We take reports of harassment very seriously and will action any reports of inappropriate behavior as quickly as possible.

To learn how to report abuse - and to whom you will be reporting - please see our [InstructLab slack Moderation Guide](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/InstructLabSlackModerationGuide.md).

## Having Trouble Joining?

If you are having trouble joining the InstructLab Slack, please file an issue in the [community repo](https://github.com/instructlab/community/issues) so we can help you.

TODO: Update with email address to get help once these are set up.

## Private Channels

InstructLab is an open source project and we value defaulting to open in all of our community communications. There are some cases where discussions must happen in private. For the sake of transparency, we are documenting these private channels and what they are used for.

- `#code-of-conduct-committee` Space for the InstructLab [Code of Conduct Committee](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/COCC.md) to discuss any reports of harassement or other violations of the project Code of Conduct and how to respond to them.
- `#mods` Space for the InstructLab [Workspace Administrators](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/InstructLabSlackModerationGuide.md#workspace-administrators) to confer privately only when necessary. We default to open and hold each other accountable to do so.
